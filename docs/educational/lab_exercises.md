### Lab 1 Questions
1. **Analysis Questions**:
   - Which target had the lowest latency? Why?
   - What does packet loss indicate about network quality?
   - How does latency vary between local and external targets?

2. **Troubleshooting Scenarios**:
   - If `polinela.ac.id` fails but `8.8.8.8` succeeds, what might be the issue?
   - What could cause high latency to local targets?
